summary: '"Essays on Horse Subjects" by F. C. Grenside is a collection of essays centered
  on various aspects of horse management and care, written in the early 20th century.
  The essays draw upon Grenside''s extensive experience as a practical horseman and
  veterinarian, addressing topics often overlooked in equine literature. The text
  aims to illuminate the complex interplay between horse anatomy, care, and performance,
  offering insights valuable to both horse owners and trainers.  The opening of the
  collection lays out the author''s intent and establishes the purpose of the essays.
  Grenside explains that the essays were born from his contributions to equine publications
  and aim to fill a gap in horse-related literature. He emphasizes the importance
  of understanding concepts like "quality" in horsesâ€”what it means, its attributes,
  and its implications for breeding and performance. He passionately discusses how
  various physical traits can affect a horse''s health and performance, setting the
  stage for the essays that will follow, which promise to offer practical advice based
  on both scientific understanding and hands-on experience. (This is an automatically
